## Homework Assignment (3 minutes)
For this week's homework, we have tasks that will help you practice the concepts of interfaces, abstract classes, and Java Reflection. These tasks are designed to deepen your understanding and provide a practical application of the concepts discussed.

Homework tasks to solidify understanding:

### Task 1: Simple Calculator Interface
Your first task is to implement a simple `Calculator` interface with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Implement this interface in a class and test its methods.

### Task 2: Advanced Shape Manipulation

For the second task, you will be diving deeper into abstract classes and interfaces.

- Create an abstract class `Shape` with the following:
    - An abstract method `area()` for calculating the area.
    - An abstract method `perimeter()` for calculating the perimeter.
    - A method `scale(double factor)` to scale the shape by a given factor.

- Implement this abstract class in two subclasses: `Circle` and `Rectangle`.

- Also, create an interface `Resizable` with a method `resize(double factor)` and make `Circle` and `Rectangle` implement this interface.

- Finally, create a utility class `ShapeUtilities` with methods for finding the shape with the largest area and the shape with the smallest perimeter from an array of `Shape` objects.

### Task 3: Java Reflection API

The last task is about Java Reflection. Write a simple program that uses the Java Reflection API to inspect a given class and list all its methods and fields.

These assignments are designed to be more challenging and comprehensive, covering multiple aspects of Java programming that we've discussed so far.
